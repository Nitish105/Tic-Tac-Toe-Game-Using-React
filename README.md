# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Using-React
To build a Tic Tac Toe game in React, create components: `Game` manages state, `Board` renders the grid, and `Square` displays individual squares. Use React state for player turns and game history. Check for a winner by defining winning combinations. Style it, test thoroughly, and deploy for others to enjoy.
